# Pullkin

The name Pullkin is a playful pun â€“ think of it like Alexander Push-kin, 
but instead of sending notifications, it's here to pull them in!

## Tool for Receiving FCM (GCM) Notifications

This tool enables subscription to notifications from Firebase Cloud Messaging. 
It facilitates receiving push notifications in a way similar to Android or Electron applications.

## Use Cases

As a developer, I needed to receive notifications to test message broadcasts. 
Additionally, I needed to receive payment confirmation codes from my banking app, 
which also arrived as push notifications.

Whatever your reason for receiving notifications, this tool can help you.

## Attribution

I am not the originator of this idea; this library is my reinterpretation 
of the push-receiving library by [Francesco149](https://github.com/Francesco149/push_receiver), 
who in turn adapted the push receiving functionality 
from the JavaScript implementation by [MatthieuLemoine](https://github.com/MatthieuLemoine). 

Without their work, this library would not exist. 
I am grateful to everyone who contributed to the development of these projects.
